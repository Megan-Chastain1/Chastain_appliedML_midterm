# Peer review of Anjana Dhakal's Midterm Project
notebook: https://github.com/anjana-codes/ml_classification_anjana/blob/main/notebooks/classification_anjana.ipynb

## 1. Clarity & Organization

Anjana's project is easy to read and understand. Imports are at the top and they've included a nice introduction. Their data visualizations are relevant to their dataset and project and the included error bars on the boxplots made those graphs easier to read. 


## 2. Feature Selection & Justification

Anjana choose to keep all 13 features as factors in their mdoel. Their justification was because they all correlate to heart risk. I agree with their justification as there is no feature more valuable than the others that has been included in the dataset.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons

The model Anjana chose worked well with a test accuracy and percision score of over 80% each. I thought it was nice they added a graph with a threshold value to evaluate model performance. The other model they chose to use (Random Forest) worked well also, and they brought up taking overfitting into consideration with it. 

## 4. Reflection Quality

Anjana's reflections are well thought out and comprehensive.  They could definitely present their project in a professional setting.
